## AI vs Manual Work Split

- **AI-generated**: ~70% - Core component structure, TypeScript interfaces, chart configurations, export utilities, responsive layouts, and initial styling
- **Manual coding**: ~20% - Custom business logic, data flow optimization, specific styling adjustments, and integration between components
- **Customization**: ~10% - Adapting AI suggestions to project requirements, fixing merge conflicts, debugging build issues, and fine-tuning user experience

## Key Benefits

AI assistance significantly accelerated development by providing solid architectural foundations, reducing boilerplate code, and ensuring TypeScript best practices. The combination of AI-generated structure with manual customization resulted in a production-ready dashboard with modern UI patterns and robust functionality.
